Kmer approach

    - Kmer_Instance mismatch scan
        Adresses the issue of having a potential mismatch regionn
        region to scan could be from min to max pos plus and minus the largest difference between two consequtive positions....

        Deals with 'Klumpa ihop kmers för och ta hänsyn till mismatches'

    - Plota för olika kmer storlekar

    - Incorporate other valuable skew meausres.
        issue here is how to  merge / balnce the two measure with each other

        - A mixture measure?

    - Use info / difference between different window radius sizes

    - Sum different regions
